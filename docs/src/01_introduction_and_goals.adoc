== Introduction and Goals

=== Context and Motivation
WIChat is a web-based question-and-answer application where users answer a series of questions from various categories within a set time limit. The platform automatically generates questions based on Wikidata and allows users to receive hints through an external language model (LLM). This functionality adds a conversational component to the game, enhancing the user experience.

RTVE has contracted ChattySw to update an experimental version of the online contest previously developed by HappySw, incorporating new interactive hint functionalities and improving the gameplay experience.

=== Key Requirements
The system must meet the following requirements:

* A web application accessible from any browser.
* User registration and authentication.
* Automatic question generation based on Wikidata.
* The ability to obtain hints generated by a language model (LLM) via an API.
* Validation and mitigation of incorrect responses from the language model.
* Time control for answering each question.
* A documented API for accessing questions and user data.
* Automatic generation of correct and incorrect answers (distractors).

=== Quality Objectives
The following quality objectives will guide architectural decisions:
