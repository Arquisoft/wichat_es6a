## Architecture Decisions

## Service-Oriented System
Our system follows a service-based architecture, where each service is responsible for a specific domain of functionality. This modular approach enhances scalability, separation of concerns, and maintainability.

Some core services include:

- AuthService: Handles user authentication and token management.

- UserService: Manages user profiles, roles, and preferences.

- QuestionService: Stores and retrieves generated quiz questions.

- LLMService: Coordinates AI-based content generation (e.g., questions and hints).

- WikidataService: Provides trivia data retrieved from structured knowledge sources.

Each service is stateless, autonomous, and communicates with others via HTTP calls through the Gateway.

## Gateway Service
The Gateway acts as the central entry point for all external clients. It is responsible for:

- Routing requests to the appropriate internal services.

- Centralizing authentication, authorization, and input validation.

- Abstracting internal service structure from external consumers.

This simplifies client interaction and ensures consistent policies across the system.

## Example Workflow of How the Architecture Works

To better understand how our service-based architecture operates in practice, we describe two typical workflows that involve several services working together: **question generation** and **AI-powered hint generation**.


### Question Generation

When an admin user requests a batch of quiz questions, the system coordinates several services:

- The **frontend** sends a request to the **Gateway**, which routes it to the service responsible for AI interactions.
- This service fetches relevant trivia data from a knowledge base and uses an external **LLM provider** to generate questions based on that data.
- Each generated question is then stored via another service that manages persistent storage.
- Finally, the response is sent back through the Gateway to the user.

This is a good example of how services collaborate, each handling a specific responsibility: routing, LLM integration, data retrieval, and persistence.

## Bulk Question Generation and Caching
To address the delay experienced when starting a game due to real-time question generation, we introduced a pre-generation and caching strategy.

- When a new game starts, the system first attempts to load questions from the database.

- If no suitable cached questions are found, it generates a batch of questions on the fly using the LLM and Wikidata services.

- These questions are then saved to the database for reuse in future games.

This drastically reduces perceived latency and improves responsiveness when starting a new game session.

Each decision was made based on the project requirements, the teamâ€™s prior experience, and the technologies provided in the base template.

.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. 
Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* ADR (https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions[Documenting Architecture Decisions]) for every important decision
* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision

.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/[Architecture Decisions] in the arc42 documentation.
There you will find links and examples about ADR.
