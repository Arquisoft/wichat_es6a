== Architecture decisions

- These decisions are not final and may change as the project evolves. They represent our current approach based on the available information and team expertise, but adjustments might be necessary as we gain more experience and face new challenges.

|Decision |Reasons |Disagvantanges
| JavaScript
| We have decided to develop the application using JavaScript because, in addition to having some prior knowledge, working with the provided template encourages us to do so, avoiding unnecessary complexity in the initial development phase.
| It is a complex language that can cause us problems while other simpler languages could make our work easier.

| React.js
| It is the most popular JavaScript framework, with extensive documentation available.
| None of us in the team have worked with it before, so we will all need to learn how to use it.

| MongoDB
| As a non-relational database, it offers ease of use. Additionally, it is widely adopted by major telecommunications companies.
| Non-relational databases are the ones with which we have the least experience.

| Node.js
| We chose Node.js to interact with the database, as it is a well-known runtime environment for backend development in web applications. It provides an efficient and scalable platform for building web and network applications in real-time using JavaScript.
| Handling CPU-intensive tasks may be less efficient due to its single-threaded event-driven architecture.

| Docker
| Containerization that facilitates deployment and scalability. It ensures a consistent environment across development and production while streamlining dependency management. Deployment is fast, making it easier to move and maintain applications. Additionally, there are many available examples of Dockerfiles that simplify implementation.
| Initial configuration of Docker may introduce some complexity. It also requires additional learning resources.

.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationales.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. 
Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* ADR (https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions[Documenting Architecture Decisions]) for every important decision
* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision

.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-9/[Architecture Decisions] in the arc42 documentation.
There you will find links and examples about ADR.
