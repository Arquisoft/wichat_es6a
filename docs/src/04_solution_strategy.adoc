.Contents
A short summary and explanation of the fundamental decisions and solution strategies, that shape system architecture. It includes

* technology decisions
* decisions about the top-level decomposition of the system, e.g. usage of an architectural pattern or design pattern
* decisions on how to achieve key quality goals
* relevant organizational decisions, e.g. selecting a development process or delegating certain tasks to third parties.

.Motivation
These decisions form the cornerstones for your architecture. They are the foundation for many other detailed decisions or implementation rules.

.Form
Keep the explanations of such key decisions short.

Motivate what was decided and why it was decided that way,
based upon problem statement, quality goals and key constraints.
Refer to details in the following sections.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-4/[Solution Strategy] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Types of Decisions

==== 1. Organizational Decisions
These decisions are related to the **work structure** and how the team is organized.

* **Using a Kanban-style project**: The decision to use a visual task management approach, Kanban, to organize work and ensure that all team members know the status of tasks and what remains to be done.
* **Using GitHub Flow as a workflow**: The decision to adopt a GitHub Flow based workflow, allowing all team members to collaborate easily through Pull Requests and ensuring that all code is reviewed before being merged into the main branch.

==== 2. Technical Decisions
These decisions are related to **how the project is built** and the tools used.

* **Using a starter template**: The decision to begin with a basic but functional project, allowing for a quick start with a pre-configured structure that works, avoiding the need to build everything from scratch.  
* **Starting the project from scratch**: Although a starter template can be used, the decision is to create a new project from scratch. This helps the team become more familiar with the code and project structure. Additionally, the previous project can be used as a reference to solve problems or improve the design without relying on it directly.  
* **Using MongoDB as the database**: Chosen because it fits well with the data used in the application, is easy to use, and was also used in the base project.  
* **Using Gemini LLM**: After testing, Gemini was determined to be the best fit for generating the desired responses and reacting effectively to the prompts.  
* **Using JavaScript as the programming language**: Selected because most available resources are in JavaScript, the base project uses it, and it is a common language for web development.  
* **Using Node.js as the framework**: Chosen for its seamless integration with JavaScript and because it was used in the base project.  
* **Using Material UI as the UI framework**: Helps in developing the applicationâ€™s user interface by providing pre-built components that simplify good design and development.  
* **Using Docker for service deployment**: Docker is used to deploy different application services independently, making them more manageable. It provides tools that simplify deployment and maintenance.  

==== 3. Quality and Maintenance Decisions
These decisions are about **ensuring that the project is high quality** and easy to maintain.

* **Using GitHub Flow and Pull Requests**: Through Pull Requests, we ensure that every code change is reviewed by the team before integration, maintaining code quality and minimizing errors in the main branch.  
* **Using Jest for testing**: Chosen because it is a widely used tool for testing this type of application and was also used in the base project, ensuring consistency in the testing code and avoiding tool mixing.  
* **Using Ruby for documentation deployment**: Selected because it is the provided tool along with a guide for this task.
