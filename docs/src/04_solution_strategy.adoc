== Solution Strategy

=== Types of Decisions

==== 1. Organizational Decisions

* **Adopting a Kanban-style project management**:  
  The team uses a Kanban board to visualize the workflow, prioritize tasks, and increase transparency. This supports continuous delivery and helps identify bottlenecks by limiting work in progress.

* **Using GitHub Flow as the development workflow**:  
  GitHub Flow is used for version control and team collaboration. It enables feature branches, code reviews via Pull Requests, and promotes consistent, stable integration.

* **Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions and SonarQube**:  
  A CI pipeline is configured using GitHub Actions to automatically run unit tests and perform code quality analysis with SonarQube. This ensures that every change is validated and checked for bugs, duplication, or security issues before merging.

==== 2. Technical Decisions

* **Starting the project from scratch with custom configuration**:  
  Although a base project exists, we decided to build from scratch to better understand the codebase and architecture. The old project is used as a reference for ideas and problem-solving.

* **Using MongoDB as the database**:  
  MongoDB is a NoSQL database well-suited for the app's data model, easy to use, and already familiar to the team.

* **Using Gemini LLM for response generation**:  
  Gemini was chosen for its effective response generation and suitability for prompt-based interactions, based on testing.

* **Using JavaScript as the primary programming language**:  
  JavaScript is widely supported, popular in web development, and was used in the base project.

* **Using Node.js as the backend environment**:  
  Node.js integrates seamlessly with JavaScript, supports event-driven programming, and was part of the original stack.

* **Using Material UI as the UI framework**:  
  Material UI provides ready-to-use components that follow design best practices and accelerate UI development.

* **Using Docker for service deployment**:  
  Docker containers allow for independent service deployment, improving scalability, maintainability, and consistency across environments.

* **Using Azure as the cloud platform**:  
  Azure offers scalable infrastructure, integration with development tools, strong security features, and built-in support for CI/CD pipelines.

* **Using a Linux-based server environment**:  
  Linux provides stability, resource efficiency, automation capabilities (via cron, bash), and compatibility with modern development tools.

* **Separation of game logic and UI components**:  
  Game logic (score calculations, answer validation, question flow) is implemented independently of the UI. This separation improves testability, reusability, and code clarity.

* **Using `setInterval` to manage game timers**:  
  Timed quizzes rely on accurate timers. A controlled `setInterval` mechanism with timestamp drift adjustment ensures precise countdown behavior.

* **Anonymous play support (no login required)**:  
  Users can participate in quizzes without registering. However, statistics and history are not saved unless the user logs in, improving accessibility while preserving data integrity.

* **User profile editing and password update**:  
  Registered users can update their profile and change their password through secure interfaces.

* **Using bcrypt to protect user passwords**:  
  All user passwords are securely hashed using the bcrypt algorithm before being stored in the database. This adds an essential layer of protection against password leaks and brute-force attacks. Bcrypt’s built-in salting and adaptive hashing features make it a strong choice for modern authentication systems.

* **Game modes based on thematic categories**:  
  The application supports different quiz modes: *Countries*, *Music*, *Cinema*, and a *Mixed Mode* with questions from all categories. This allows users to choose based on interest and enhances replay value.

* **Daily question generation via cron + Wikidata**:  
  A cron job runs daily on the server to generate new quiz questions from live data in Wikidata. This ensures updated and diverse content without manual intervention.

* **Using Swagger for API documentation**:  
  Swagger (OpenAPI) is used to automatically generate and maintain up-to-date documentation for the application's RESTful APIs. This tool provides a visual interface where developers and users can explore the available API endpoints, see request/response formats, and even test the APIs interactively. It helps streamline development, improve communication with third-party services, and reduces integration errors by keeping API documentation current.

==== 3. Quality and Maintainability Decisions

* **Using GitHub Flow and Pull Requests for code review**:  
  All changes are reviewed via Pull Requests before merging to maintain code quality and minimize integration errors.

* **Using Jest for unit testing**:  
  Jest is a mature, widely-used testing framework for JavaScript projects and was used in the base project, ensuring consistency.

* **Using jest-cucumber for BDD-style testing**:  
  With jest-cucumber, test scenarios can be written in natural language (Gherkin). This improves readability and collaboration between developers and non-technical stakeholders. It was already part of the base project.

* **Using pepeter for React component testing**:  
  Pepeter integrates well with React, making component behavior testing more expressive. It was included in the original project setup and maintained due to its convenience.

* **Using Cypress for end-to-end testing**:  
  Full user flows—such as starting a quiz, submitting answers, and viewing results—are tested with Cypress to ensure the system works reliably after each update.

* **Using Ruby for documentation deployment**:  
  Ruby was chosen as the deployment tool for documentation because it is part of the recommended tooling and comes with existing setup instructions.

* **Modular and testable code structure**:  
  Each system module adheres to the single-responsibility principle, ensuring ease of maintenance, clearer ownership, and higher test coverage.
