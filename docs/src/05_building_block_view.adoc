== Building Block View

---
This view shows the static decomposition of the WIChat system into its main building blocks (components, services) and outlines their responsibilities and primary relationships.

=== High-Level System Overview (Context Recap)

---
The following diagram shows the WIChat system as a whole (blackbox), interacting with the primary user and external data/service providers (Wikidata, LLM).

=== Whitebox Overall System (Level 1)

---
This section describes the top-level decomposition of the WIChat trivia game system into its internal microservices and components.

==== Overview Diagram (Level 1)

---
The following diagram shows the main internal building blocks (Level 1) of the WIChat system and their primary interactions.

image::BuildingBlockView2.png["Level 1 Whitebox Diagram for WIChat System", align="center"]

==== Motivation

---
The WIChat system is decomposed into microservices (Level 1) for:

* **Separation of Concerns:** UI (`WebApp`), routing/aggregation (`Gateway Service`), user management (`Users Service`), authentication (`Auth Service`), question logic (`Question Service`), history/statistics (`History Service`), interaction/cache with Wikidata (`Wikidata Service`), AI suggestions (`LLM Service`).
* **Independent Scalability:** Each service can scale independently based on demand (e.g., `Question Service` during gameplay, `Auth Service` during login peaks).
* **Technological Flexibility:** Allows different technologies per service and independent updates.
* **Maintainability & Testability:** Smaller services are easier to manage, test, and deploy.
* **Resilience:** Failures in non-critical services (e.g., `LLM Service`) minimally affect gameplay.

==== Level 1 Building Blocks (Blackboxes)

---
===== `WebApp` (Frontend)
*Responsibility*:: Provides the interactive web interface. Displays questions, answers, images, scores, statistics, and user profiles. Communicates only with the `Gateway Service`.  
*Interfaces (Consumed)*:: Gateway API (REST/WebSocket).

---
===== `Gateway Service`
*Responsibility*:: Single entry point. Routes requests to microservices (`Auth`, `Users`, `Questions`, `History`, `LLM`, `Wikidata`), manages CORS, basic validation, exposes Swagger and metrics (Prometheus), checks downstream service health.  
*Interfaces*::  
* *Provided:* Gateway API (REST), `/metrics`, `/health`, `/api-doc`.  
* *Consumed:* Auth, Users, Question, History, LLM, Wikidata APIs.  
*Technology*:: Node.js, Express, Axios.

---
===== `Auth Service`
*Responsibility*:: User authentication (validation and issuance of JWT tokens).  
*Interfaces*::  
* *Provided:* `/login` (REST).  
* *Consumed:* Users Service or direct database access.  
*Technology*:: Node.js/Express.

---
===== `Users Service`
*Responsibility*:: CRUD operations for users, avatar management.  
*Interfaces*::  
* *Provided:* `/addUser`, `/user/{id}` (REST).  
* *Consumed:* Database.

===== `Wikidata Service`
*Responsibility*:: Facade and cache for Wikidata. Queries SPARQL, processes and caches results.  
*Interfaces*::  
* *Provided:* `/api/entries/{…}`.  
* *Consumed:* Wikidata SPARQL and database (Mongoose).

---
===== `LLM Service` (Hint Service)
*Responsibility*:: Orchestrates question and hint generation. Fetches base data from Wikidata, calls the external LLM API, formats and persists questions.  
*Interfaces*::  
* *Provided:* `/generateQuestions`, `/getHint`, `/getHintWithQuery`.  
* *Consumed:* Gateway → Wikidata Service, external LLM API, Gateway → Question Service.  
*Technology*:: Node.js, Express, Axios, @google/genai.

---
===== `Database`
*Responsibility*:: Persistent storage for users, history, questions, Wikidata cache.  
*Interfaces*:: MongoDB driver consumed by services.  
*Technology*:: MongoDB.

[[level2-refinements]]
== Level 2 (Refinements)

---
=== White Box LLM Service (Hint Service)

==== Motivation (LLM Service Focus)

---
This service encapsulates the complex logic of interacting with external providers (LLM, Wikidata Service) and coordinates multiple steps to generate questions and hints.

==== Internal Logic Flow / Responsibilities

===== Question Generation Orchestration (`/generateQuestions` endpoint)

---
image::BuildingBlockViewGenerateQuestions.png["Generation Questions Flow Diagram", align="center"]

1. Receives category and number of questions from the Gateway Service.  
2. Requests base data (including `imageUrl`) from the Wikidata Service via Gateway.  
3. For each entry:  
   * Formats textual information (`formatEntryInfo`).  
   * Constructs a detailed prompt for the external LLM API.  
   * Calls the LLM API (`sendQuestionToLLM`).  
   * Parses and validates the JSON response (`parseJsonResponse`), retrying if needed.  
   * Combines generated text with `imageUrl`.  
   * Persists the question via `/addQuestion` endpoint through the Gateway.  
4. Aggregates all generated questions and returns them to the Gateway Service.

---
===== Hint Generation (`/getHint` endpoint)

---
image::BuildingBlockViewHintRequest.png["Get Hint Flow Diagram", align="center"]

1. Receives the question text and answer options from the Gateway Service.  
2. Builds a prompt requesting a hint without revealing the correct answer.  
3. Calls the LLM API and parses the response.  
4. Returns a single-sentence hint.

---
===== Conversational Hint Generation (`/getHintWithQuery` endpoint)

---
1. Similar to `/getHint`, but incorporates a specific user query.  
2. Filters to prevent direct revelation of the answer.  
3. Builds and sends the prompt to the LLM, parses and returns the conversational hint.

[[level3-concepts]]
== Level 3 (Refinements / Concepts)

---
=== Concept: Question Generation and Storage Flow

**Involved components:** Gateway Service, LLM Service, Wikidata Service, Question Service, Database, Wikidata SPARQL, External LLM.

1. WebApp requests questions by category from the Gateway.  
2. Gateway routes to LLM Service (`/generateQuestions`).  
3. LLM Service requests base data from Wikidata Service via Gateway.  
4. Wikidata Service returns cached data.  
5. LLM Service formats and sends a prompt to the external LLM.  
6. LLM responds in JSON; LLM Service parses and validates.  
7. LLM Service unifies text and image and calls `/addQuestion` through Gateway.  
8. Gateway routes to Question Service, which stores it in the database.  
9. LLM Service returns the questions to the original caller.

---
=== Concept: Statistics Calculation

**Responsible component:** History Service

When `/stats` is called:
* Retrieves all game records for the user.  
* Calculates aggregated statistics in-memory (total points, number of games, win/loss ratio, averages, most played category).  
* Returns results, including the 3 most outstanding games.

> ⚠️ For users with very large histories, performance may degrade if not paginated.
