== Quality Requirements

The **WIChat** system prioritizes five critical quality attributes to ensure success:

1. **Usability**:  
   - Goal: An intuitive interface that allows users to play, access hints, view/edit their profile, and inspect their game statistics with minimal friction.

2. **Maintainability**:  
   - Goal: Modular, well-documented codebase (separation of concerns, clear folder structure, descriptive comments) to facilitate onboarding and future feature additions (e.g., new quiz categories).

3. **Performance**:  
   - Goal: Low latency in all interactive operations:  
     - Quiz question generation (≤ 200 ms per request under normal load).  
     - LLM prompt/response turnaround (≤ 500 ms).  
     - Profile and statistics retrieval (≤ 150 ms).

4. **Security**:  
   - Goal: Robust protection of user credentials and session data, and resistance to common web attacks:  
     - **Password hashing**: All passwords are salted and hashed with bcrypt before storage.  
     - **Session tokens**: JWTs signed with strong secret and short TTL (1 h), transmitted via HTTPS; no use of opaque session IDs in URLs.  
     - **No token reuse**: Tokens are checked on every request; unable to override identity by simply including a different token.
     - **Input validation**: Every input field (e.g., login credentials) is validated 

5. **Functionality**:  
   - Goal: Reliably satisfy core business workflows:  
     - Automatic question/answer generation from Wikidata entries (with image support).  
     - Conversational hint service with RAG-based hallucination mitigation.  
     - Accurate user statistics tracking and retrieval.  
     - User profile editing (username, password, avatar) with immediate effect.

These quality requirements guide every architectural and implementation decision, ensuring WIChat meets stakeholder expectations and delivers a seamless, secure user experience.
