In addition to what is shown in the diagram, we will also use arc42 for documentation.

Motivation::
Initially, the application is deployed using Docker in developers systems, depending on resource availability. This way, each developer will have a local deployment environment for testing. 

Quality and/or Performance Features::
- The system is designed with microservices, each running in its own container for better scalability and fault tolerance.
- A **database service** will be used for structured data, and a **File Storage Service** will handle multimedia content.
- **arc42 documentation** will be managed within a dedicated Docker container.
