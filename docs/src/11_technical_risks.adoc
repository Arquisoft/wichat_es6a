== Risks and Technical Debt

=== Technical Risks

1. **Inadequate Version Control Management**  
**** Possible Issues  
- GitHub conflicts due to multiple team members collaborating.  
- Risk of code loss or overwriting.  

**** Preventive Measure  
- Define a clear Git workflow with mandatory Pull Requests.  

2. **Tight Deadlines and Lack of Experience**  
**** Possible Issues  
- Inability to complete planned tasks due to other courses or poor time estimation.  
- Difficulties in implementing advanced features due to lack of experience in JavaScript.  
- Increased number of errors due to limited proficiency in the language.  

**** Preventive Measure  
- Better task organization and development time estimation.  
- Self-learning of the language to improve proficiency.  

3. **Documentation Deficiencies**  
**** Possible Issues  
- Code with few comments and insufficient technical documentation.  
- Difficulty for other team members to understand the existing code.  

**** Preventive Measure  
- Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation in the GitHub repository.  

4. **Lack of Automated Testing**  
**** Possible Issues  
- Dependence on manual testing, which is prone to errors.  
- Increased time to detect and fix bugs.  

**** Preventive Measure  
- Introduce unit and functional testing using tools like Jest or Mocha.  

5. **Lack of Code Standards**  
**** Possible Issues  
- Different programming styles within the team.  
- Difficulty in unifying code from different team members.  

**** Preventive Measure  
- Define common code standards to ensure consistency and ease of collaboration.  

6. **Inefficient and Repetitive Code**  
**** Possible Issues  
- Lack of modularity and code reuse.  
- Difficulty in project maintenance and scalability.  

**** Preventive Measure  
- Apply modular programming principles and perform periodic refactoring.  

7. **Suboptimal Performance**  
**** Possible Issues  
- Inefficient use of data structures and algorithms.  
- Potential performance issues during application execution.  

**** Preventive Measure  
- Review and optimize the code once it is functional.  

=== Technical Debt

1. **Tasks organization**  
**** Poor organization of the tasks to be carried out. We started by selecting a few key points to work on, but as we developed them and due to the relationships between them, we ended up covering more than what was initially selected. As a result, our current application has a significant amount of development across all parts, but none of them are fully complete or entirely functional.

2. **No Tests created**  
**** Functionality has been developed, but no testing has been done. This means our code has a coverage percentage below the required level, and it is not entirely clear whether everything implemented works correctly. Tests must be carried out as soon as possible, and proper planning is necessary since they take time and should not affect development.

3. **Tests created with low coverage**  
**** Initially, tests were created with a low coverage percentage. While some progress has been made in increasing the test coverage, it is still under 80%. Efforts need to continue to ensure comprehensive test coverage across the application.

4. **Using Empathy, but switching to Gemini**  
**** We initially used Empathy for LLM-based responses. However, the model frequently failed, causing delays and extra work. Over time, this debt accumulated, and we eventually replaced it with Gemini. This decision helped stabilize the application's performance but caused some disruptions earlier in development.

5. **Direct service calls without using the Gateway**  
**** At the start, services were implemented and called directly without using a Gateway. This decision led to technical debt, as we had to invest significant time later in the development process to refactor and introduce the Gateway, which is necessary for scalability and proper separation of concerns.

6. **Insufficient documentation updates**  
**** The documentation was not sufficiently updated during development, leading to discrepancies between the actual implementation and the documentation. As a result, certain parts of the project were not properly reflected, making it difficult for team members and future contributors to follow the project flow.

7. **Initial game images generated with AI causing delays**  
**** At first, we used AI to generate images for the game based on the questions. However, this approach led to increased wait times, and the quality of the images was not optimal. Subsequently, time was spent switching to images obtained from Wikidata, which was a more efficient solution.
