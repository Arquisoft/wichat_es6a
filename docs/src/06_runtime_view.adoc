== Runtime View

- For now, the following section will be updated as we gain a clearer understanding of how different components interact in real-time.

==== User Registration

User registration in the application is managed through the user microservice (userservice).

During registration, the user enters a name and password. If the registration is successful, a confirmation message is displayed. Otherwise, an error message is shown.

==== Login

User authentication in the application is managed through the authentication microservice (*authservice*).  

To log in, the user enters their credentials. If the information is valid, the application displays the available options.

.Contents
The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the systemâ€™s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

* important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
* interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighboring systems?
* operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
* error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios (sequences, workflows) is their *architectural relevance*. It is *not* important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should rather document a representative selection.

.Motivation
You should understand how (instances of) building blocks of your system perform their job and communicate at runtime.
You will mainly capture scenarios in your documentation to communicate your architecture to stakeholders that are less willing or able to read and understand the static models (building block view, deployment view).

.Form
There are many notations for describing scenarios, e.g.

* numbered list of steps (in natural language)
* activity diagrams or flow charts
* sequence diagrams
* BPMN or EPCs (event process chains)
* state machines
* ...


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-6/[Runtime View] in the arc42 documentation.





Esto es lo que estaba escrito antes:

=== <Runtime Scenario 1>


* _<insert runtime diagram or textual description of the scenario>_
* _<insert description of the notable aspects of the interactions between the
building block instances depicted in this diagram.>_

It is possible to use a sequence diagram:

[plantuml,"Sequence diagram",png]
----
actor Alice
actor Bob
database Pod as "Bob's Pod"
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response
Alice  --> Pod: Store route
Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
Alice <-- Bob: another authentication Response
----

=== <Runtime Scenario 2>

=== ...

=== <Runtime Scenario n>
