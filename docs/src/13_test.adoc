== Test Documentation

This section provides a structured overview of the automated tests implemented in the project.

=== Unit Testing

==== questionsService

Tests for handling questions and user-question interaction history.

* `questions-model.test.js`: Ensures question model logic behaves as expected.
* `question-history-service.test.js`: Tests logic related to question selection and historical storage.

==== webapp (Frontend React components)

Tests for UI components and their auxiliary logic.

* `HowToPlayWindow.test.js`: Verifies tutorial/instruction modal behavior.
* `editProfileWindowAuxFunc.test.js`: Tests helper functions for profile editing.

==== gatewayservice

* `gateway-service.test.js`: Validates core functionalities of the gateway layer and inter-service routing.

==== llmservice

Tests for interactions with the language model backend.

* `llm-service.test.js`: Main test suite for verifying service logic.
* `getRandomEntriesAuxiliaryFunction.test.js`: Tests helper for random entry selection.
* `generate-questions.test.js`: Validates question generation logic.
* `parseJSONAuxFunction.test.js`: Tests robustness of JSON parsing.
* `sendQuestionToLLM.test.js`: Ensures API communication with LLM works correctly.
* `llm-service-AuxiliaryFunctions.test.js`: Collection of miscellaneous helper function tests.

==== wikidataservice

Tests for caching and querying Wikidata.

* `wikidataCacheService.test.js`: Validates caching behavior.
* `wikidata-service.test.js`: Tests high-level query logic.
* `wikidataQueries.test.js`: Ensures individual query builders function correctly.

==== userservice

* `auth-service.test.js`: Tests user authentication logic.
* `user-model.test.js`: Model tests for user creation, validation, and retrieval.
* `user-service.test.js`: Service-level tests for managing user data.

=== Load Testing with Gatling

A load test was performed using the Gatling tool to evaluate the performance of the application under stress.

==== Objective

To assess the behavior of critical endpoints under high user concurrency conditions.

==== Test Design

- **Tool**: Gatling
- **Endpoints tested**:
  - `POST /adduser` (user registration)
  - `POST /login` (user authentication)
- **Simulated users**: 1000
- **Ramp-up duration**: 60 seconds
- **Pause strategy**: Controlled pauses between actions to simulate realistic user behavior
- **Assertions**:
  - Maximum response time must be â‰¤ 5000 ms
  - At least 95% of requests must succeed (HTTP 200 or 201)

==== Results

- The system respected the maximum response time threshold of 5000 ms.
- Success rate consistently exceeded 95%.
- HTML reports (index.html and request-specific reports) confirmed that both login and registration endpoints handled the load without significant performance degradation.

==== Conclusion

The system demonstrated robustness and scalability, successfully supporting high traffic without compromising stability or performance.

=== End-to-End (E2E) Testing

End-to-End tests were implemented using the `jest-cucumber` and `puppeteer` frameworks. These tests simulate real user behavior interacting with the application through the browser, ensuring the system works as a whole.

==== Tools and Frameworks
- **Test Runner**: Jest
- **BDD Layer**: jest-cucumber
- **Automation**: Puppeteer
- **Execution**: Locally and in CI (GitHub Actions compatible)

==== E2E Scenarios Implemented

* `register-form.feature` + `01-register-form.steps.js`:
  - Simulates a new user registering on the platform.
  - Verifies the presence of a success message upon form submission.

* `login-form.feature` + `02-login-form.steps.js`:
  - Simulates login of a previously registered user.
  - Verifies redirection to `/home` on success.

* `stats-access.feature` + `04-stats-access.steps.js`:
  - Simulates a user logging in and navigating to the statistics page.
  - Ensures redirection to `/statistics` occurs successfully.

* `questions-access.feature` + `05-questions-access.steps.js`:
  - Simulates a user logging in and accessing the questions page.
  - Validates redirection to `/questions`.

==== Conclusion

These E2E tests cover critical user flows including registration, authentication, and navigation. They are crucial for regression testing and confidence in the deployed UI.
