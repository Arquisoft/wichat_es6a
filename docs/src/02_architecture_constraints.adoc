* **Web Technology:** The application must be developed using modern web technologies (React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend).
* **Database:** MongoDB will be used for data storage.
* **Language Model:** A language model (LLM) will be integrated through an external API.
* **Question Source:** Questions must be automatically generated based on Wikidata data.
* **Response Time:** Answers to questions must be recorded within a set time limit.

=== Organizational Constraints
The following organizational constraints affect the project:

* **Delivery Deadlines:** The application must be operational before the project closure as agreed.
* **Documentation:** The architecture and development must be documented following the arc42 standard.
* **Open Source:** The source code must be hosted in an accessible repository for review and tracking.

=== Security and Privacy Constraints
To ensure user security and privacy, the following constraints are established:

* **Data Management:** User data must be protected in compliance with data protection regulations.
* **Response Validation:** Potential errors or "hallucinations" from the language model must be mitigated to prevent incorrect information in hints.

These constraints will define the boundaries within which WIChat will be designed and developed.
